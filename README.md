# SDN-IP
Test BGP Routing Optimization in SDN Environmet
# INTRODUCTION :
SDN-IP is an ONOS application that allows a Software Defined Network to connect to external networks on the Internet using the standard Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). Externally, from a BGP perspective, the SDN network appears as a single Autonomous System (AS) that behaves as any traditional AS. Within the AS, the SDN-IP application provides the integration mechanism between BGP and ONOS. At the protocol level, SDN-IP behaves as a regular BGP speaker. From ONOS perspective, itâ€™s just an application that uses its services to install and update the appropriate forwarding state in the SDN data plane.
